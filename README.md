# College-Database-Demo
 Android demo project
 
 This is an Android project to demonstrate a variety of features from Android and other platforms that support Android. 
 
 The app itself isn't especially complicated in function. The user enters a name or portion of a name in a search box, the app calls an API to retrieve college information, the JSON data are returned to the app, and are displayed in a list. The user can tap any entry and then edit one of the columns which had a null value when returned from the API (the state/province value), and save to the local SQLite-backed database. 
 
 
 This project demonstrates the following Android concepts:
 
 Fragments. Part of Jetpack IO UI, allows the swapping in and out of reusable elements.
 
 ViewModels. Part of Jetpack Architecture, the ViewModel carries objects associated with a UI.
 
 LiveData. Part of Jetpack Architecture, an Observable-based wrapper whereby changes detected can trigger an action, such as an update of the UI.
 
 Room Database. Part of Jetpack Architecture, a layer that sits on top of SQLite, providing a more structured approach to SQL operations.
 
 Navigation. Part of Jetpack Architecture, often used with UI and swapping Fragments in and out of view. 
 
 AppCompat. Part of Jetpack Foundation, the basic building block for an Android application.
 
 Layout. Part of Jetpack UI, in this context, the ConstraintLayout for positioning controls on a screen.
 
 
 This project further includes the following concepts:
 
 View Binding. Introduced in 2019, view binding replaced synthetic references to UI objects (by ID) which, itself, had replaced use of findViewById.
 
 Retrofit. A set of libraries by Square for making RESTful/API service calls. 
 
 
 The app was not written to be flashy or sophisticated - there is virtually no user input error checking or use of bitmap objects or animations. The app could be used as a basis for a larger app, or to learn Android concepts.  There should be sufficient information here such that a hiring manager or project manager can discern - assuming they know how to code in Kotlin - whether this developer is competent. The application began with an empty container created in Android Studio (August 2021) and additional features were gradually added.
